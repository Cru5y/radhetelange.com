# hello-world

//the idea i want to give of myself to others is like that, a concept of something, of someone great, someone that looks at things differently, with an eye of revolution.

//i want to be someone that can change the world.

//i want to be someone that can live an adventure and come out happily out of it.

//what i've seen in lord of the rings is what shaped my idea of hero, someone that can make people happy through his sacrifices.

//i want heaven on earth.

//and we could do it if we weren't all that fucking stupidly drunk for power.
