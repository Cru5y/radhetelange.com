# hello-world

//idk why i am doing this or what i do anythign for, but i know that i love to do some specific things.

//i don' really know why, probably i developed some aspirations, i whould like to think at myself in a way that is similar to what i think about my heroes.

//so the frist thing should be to define my heroes, but they are too abstract, they are not really there, they are ideas, i like their ideas, and just that.

//so the idea i want to give of myself to others is like that, a concept of something, of someone great, someone that looks at things differently, with an eye of revolution.

//i want to be someone that can change the world.

//i want to be someone that can live an adventure and come out happily out of it.

//what i've seen in lord of the rings is what shaped my idea of hero, someone that can make people happy through his sacrifices.

//i want heaven on earth.

//and we could do it if we weren't all that fucking stupidly drunk for power.
